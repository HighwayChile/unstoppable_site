Web design for koke


# How to use  
This is a locally-hosted html page, so it has no interactive functionality with the wider internet. 
At most, the user may navigate through static pages and view the information(or lack of).  

To use: download and unzip the repository, then run "koke.html"  

More functionality can easily be added, but we need to know how you are going to host.
